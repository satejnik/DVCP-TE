% TS_base is the integration step size in hours.  The simulink model
% is using a fixed step size (Euler) method.  Variable step-size methods
% don't work very well (high noise level).  TS_base is also the sampling
% period of most discrete PI controllers used in the simulation.

% TS_save is the sampling period for saving results.  The following
% variables are saved at the end of a run:

% OpCost  -  the instantaneous operating cost, $/hr, length N

% idv     -  the TE plant disturbances, N by 20 matrix
